# Na-ve-Bayes-classification-calculation-on-Yacht-Hydrodynamics-Data-Set

> Use the result of probability calculation to determine the residual resistance of the yacht under specific settings applied with the Na√Øve Bayes algorithm. Discretized the residual resistance data into three levels for probability calculations. Analyze which value of the residual resistance is more likely to occur (with the highest probability) for calculation of the yacht speed.
